# 4-Bit-Binary-Counter-with-Display
A 4-bit binary counter built in Logisim that drives two seven-segment displays. The circuit counts from55 to 70 using an enable bit and three counting bits. The design process involved creating truth tables, optimizing logic with Karnaugh maps, and implementing the final circuit with logic gates.
